# OLED Less Saturation
PS Vita OLED Less Saturation Homebrew
This homebrew application allows users to toggle the color space mode on their PS Vita OLED models, making the colors less saturated. It modifies the display settings and provides a way to launch and terminate the PSP emulator.

# Usage:
install vpk file and run the application. The application will automatically toggle the color space mode when started. It retrieves the current color space mode from the system registry. It sets the new color space mode to the opposite of the current mode (desaturated if currently saturated, and vice versa).
